# Why Apollo API?

Apollo helps you fine-tune AI systems systematically across many relevant test cases. By evaluating and comparing outputs to build decision making workflows. Users can test quality and catch regressions faster.

Our library allows you to do three things:

- Performance benchmarks for AI systems against specific outcomes
- Build automated tasks or back-test existing ones
- Detect real-time changes in data

You have access to a user interface (UI) and python library for fine-tuning your AI systems for specific use-cases, creating automated workflows and developing data driven insights from real-time changes in your data sets.

## Regression tests vs Automated pipelines

Let's discover **Apollo SDK in less than 2 minutes**.

### Evaluating prompt quality

**With Apollo python library and CLI toolkit, you can:**

- **Detecting real-time changes** in your data
- Automating tasks against **image, video, audio or text**
- Simplifying the process of **back-testing quality** for your AI models
- Making sure your integration is robust, so you **never again have to worry about stuck/stale data or false-positives**
- **Test multiple prompts** against predefined test cases
- **Evaluate quality and catch regressions** by comparing LLM outputs side-by-side
- **Speed up evaluations** with caching and concurrent tests
- **Flag bad outputs automatically** by setting "expectations"
- Use as a **command line tool, or integrate into your workflow with our library**
- **Use any** AI provider, API or database under one API

`apollo-sdk` produces table views that allow you to quickly review prompt outputs across many inputs. The goal: tune prompts systematically across all relevant test cases, instead of testing prompts by trial and error.

#### Usage (command line)

_Support for user interface as output type coming soon_

**It works on the command line, you can output to [`json`, `csv`, `yaml`]:**

### ML Validation & Automation via User Interface

- Apollo can help you **quickly automate tasks** for model management, performance, labeling, object detection and more.
- Teams can use Apollo to **build native in-app connections** related to active response, content moderation, risk management, fraud detection, etc.
- Some **automate their personal lives** with Apollo by integrating against discord communities or their personal lives
